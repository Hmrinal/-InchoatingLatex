# Inchoating Latex

LATEX typesetting is done with the use of special tags or instructions that allow you to format your document in a variety of ways. When conventional commands are insufficient to meet a specific requirement, new commands can be written.

### Most of the LATEX commands are simple words preceded by a special character

- \textbf : boldface the text which can be used to emphasize something particular in a paragraph 
- \begin{itemize} : starts an environment
- \item : this is an item part of a list, and thus has to be formatted accordingly. Like a list start point
- \item[\S] : does the same as item, except that inside the brackets is \S that changes the black dot(bullet point) before the line for a special character.
